## JSX

- It is a syntax to help with React
- It is not HTML in JS
- It is HTML-like or XML-like syntax
- JS Engine will not understand this code as-is
- Parcel uses Babel package to transpile the code to JS before it reaches the JS Engine
- JSX Code => transpiled to React.createElement => returns ReactElement i.e. JS Object => on rendering HTMLElement
- JSX attributes are camelCase
- H.W. - image src, a href in JSX?

## Components

### Class-based components
- OLD

### Functional components
